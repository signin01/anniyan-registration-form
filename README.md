Anniyan.com Registration Form
A functional, Zoro-themed registration web application featuring real-time input validation and dynamic UI updates.

 Project Description
This project demonstrates a secure and user-friendly registration interface. It uses JavaScript to monitor user behavior as they type, ensuring that the data entered is valid before allowing the form to be submitted. The design features a custom background image of Zoro with a polished, modern "card" layout.

 Features
Live Input Validation: Validates the Name, Email, and Password fields instantly using JavaScript input event listeners.

Dynamic Submit Logic: The "Submit" button remains disabled and grayed out until all validation rules are met.

Custom UI/UX:

Background Overlay: Zoro background image with a semi-transparent CSS overlay for high text readability.

Visual Feedback: Instant error messages (e.g., "Min 6 characters needed") appear in red when rules are broken.

Responsive Design: Centered card layout that works across different screen sizes.
